About the book
---------------------------

Both in the libraries and on the internet plenty of resources are available regarding the Distributed Systems topic.
All of them are just a better explanation of the same exact source of truth, i.e. academic [papers](#papers) published 
by the brightest minds in the world. This book is just an ordered collection of all those publications. 
The primary order of the chapters is based on the citations dependency in the publications, secondary order 
is based on the year of publication and finally the last criteria is based on the topic dependency. There are 
three editions of the book: [Essential](#essential-edition--), [Virtuoso](#virtuoso-edition--) and
[Maestro](#maestro-edition--). The Essential Edition contains the historical and most important 
publications that are at the core of our current distributed systems. The Virtuoso Edition contains the 
essential edition papers and some recent distributed systems that are built with the technology 
provided in the essential papers. Finally, the Maestro Edition is a massive collection of the most relevant papers 
regarding the topic in the academic world.
